## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Low adoption (eNaira repeat) | Medium | High | G2P use case, agent incentives |
| Technical delays | Low | High | Proven tech only; avoid custom |
| Regulatory delays | Medium | Medium | Parliamentary engagement early |
| Cybersecurity incident | Low | Critical | Multi-layer defense; insurance |
| Diaspora political pressure | Low | Medium | Competitive pricing; transparency |

### Contingency Plans

**If Governor delays approval:**
- Pivot to payment system modernization
- Reduce scope to pilot only
- Timeline: +6-12 months

**If legislation blocked:**
- Work with Parliament on amendments
- Seek compromise on privacy terms
- Alternative: Regulatory sandbox

**If SE hardware delayed:**
- Use eSIM-only for initial pilot
- Extend timeline by 4-8 weeks
- Source from alternative vendors
